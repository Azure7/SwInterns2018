# SOLIDWORKS 2018 Summer Comp-Sci Internships
So... you've come to our booth at the career fair and scanned the qr code. Please close this repo and solve one (or more!) of the problems below in the _Choose your own adventure_ section. This should be a fast exercise, not complicated. Write clearly, write correctly. State any assumptions you make. When you're done, create a pull request for us. We look forward to chatting over your code! 

## Choose Your Own Adventure

The following are fairly simple programming exercises. You can choose whatever you like to solve and solve it in whichever language you like. You can submit two answers, one that just gets the job done and the second one that is a more complete experience. Think about the interaction you might need or the output it generates, how could you display it? Be creative. The first solution should take just a few minutes, the second one depends on how you decide to tackle it.
