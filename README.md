# SOLIDWORKS 2018 Summer Comp-Sci Internships
So... you're waiting in line to talk to one of us at the booth and tell us who you are. While you're waiting, flip your resume over and solve one (or more!) of these problems. This should be a fast exercise, not complicated. Write clearly, write correctly. State any assumptions you make. Alernatively, while in line clone this repo, write the solution in your branch and make a pull request all from your phone!
