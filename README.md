# SOLIDWORKS 2018 Summer Comp-Sci Internships
So... you've come to our booth at the career fair and scanned the qr code. Please close this repo and solve one (or more!) of the problems below in the _Choose your own adventure_ section. This should be a fast exercise, not complicated. Write clearly, write correctly. State any assumptions you make. When you're done, create a pull request for us. We look forward to chatting over your code!
